### Chapter 1 – Preliminary Cleanup and Merging
- Data loading and cleaning.
- Merging different datasets into a unified structure for analysis.

---

### Chapter 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **2.1 Statistical analysis**  
  - Computes summary statistics and basic comparisons across regions.  
  - **Meat consumption findings (2022):** Highlights key insights for meat consumption differences.  
  - **Vegetable consumption findings (2022):** Summarises vegetable consumption across regions.  

- **2.2 Pretty visuals to aid in EDA**  
  - Graphical exploration of consumption patterns using plots and charts.

---

### Chapter 3 – Hypothesis Testing through Permutation (Meat Consumption)
- **3.1 Testing if Europe really does eat more meat**  
  - Uses permutation testing to evaluate regional differences.  
- **3.2 Bootstrap Resampling and Hypothesis Testing 2**  
  - Applies bootstrap resampling for robust statistical inference.  
- Multiple `## Analysis` sections present test outputs and interpretation.

---

### Chapter 4 – Linear Regression
- **4.1 Meat Consumption and GDP Per Capita**  
  - **Scatter Plot:** Visualises relationship between GDP per capita and meat consumption.  
  - **Scatterplot Analysis:** Interprets observed trends.  
  - **Model Training:** Fits regression models to quantify predictive power.

### Chapter 5 – [Add details if present]
- (If Chapter 5 exists in your notebook, describe it here. In the preview we extracted, only Chapters 1–4 were visible.)

---

## How to Use
1. Open `CA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
2. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.  
3. Navigate using the built-in [Table of Contents](./CA.ipynb) (clickable links at the top of the notebook).  

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy` (depending on which are imported in the notebook)

---

## Summary
This notebook provides a data-driven exploration of dietary patterns, connecting food consumption with socioeconomic factors using descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling.
